    I'm a master's student in the CSE department at the University of California, 
    San Diego with a focus on AI. I received my undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in computer science at the University of Illinois
    Urbana-Champaign researching under [Dr. Huy Tran](https://huytrtran.github.io/).

    I have a broad interest in science-related applications of reinforcement learning and deep learning.
    More specifically, I hope to explore how AI systems can make new discoveries and find more efficient solutions to real-world problems.
